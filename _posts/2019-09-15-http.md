### Konichiwa Internet!!!
Have you ever heard of the word <b>‘h t t p’</b> ...seems daunting isn’t it?

But I’m definitely [like 200%] sure you make a use of it everyday [ if you use the internet a lot...like me :p ]...how you ask...
Well...you won’t be reading this article, hell even surfing the net without it.

If you haven't noticed or even just ignored it, try clicking on the address bar of your web-browser and check the starting of the funky looking string present there...

What do you see?.... The funky looking string of characters is beginning with ‘http’ or ‘https’ right?!

And this is the case for each and every website present on the internet.
Now, you must be thinking what is it and what does it even do?
Well, that’s what I’m here for… ( ﾟヮﾟ)/


### Let's get started..
http in it’s full form is Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

Hmm...now you’ll ask what a Protocol is?...well protocol(s) is/are some set of instructions that allow two or more entities to communicate with each other or transmit information to each other.

As we can see from http’s full form that it is a kind of ‘transfer protocol’. But what does it transfer?...

Well you guessed it → website data like html [ Hypertext Markup Language ] along with some other misc. stuff like the response and request of the server and client.
&nbsp;
Whoa whoa slow down…many big words used...!!!

Hmm..what does request,response, server or client even mean?

Well, ‘request’ is the client asking for resources like text or content for a particular webpage from a server
And ‘response’ is the exact opposite, it is the server telling the client that it has sent the resources and it also gives relevant status information about the request

This is the same case for when you asking your teacher to go to the washroom....like when you ask your teacher whether you can go to the washroom or not is a form of ‘request’ and when the teacher replies back whether it’s a yes or a no [you’re in trouble] is a form of ‘response’ to that ‘request’.

According to the above example, the ‘server’ in our http’s response-request paradigm can also deny the request resulting in many ‘errors’ you can see on the internet while surfing.
How you ask?...

Well, you might’ve encountered some pages saying “404 NOT FOUND” or something like that. This is http’s way of saying that you’ve encountered an error and your request has been denied.

### Phew...

By now, you know that, every http interaction includes a request and a response. Now let me introduce a new ‘attribute’ or ‘feature’ of http by saying that it is also stateless.

What do i mean by that?..it simply means that all ‘requests’ are separate from each other so every request must contain enough information on their own to fulfill the request.That means that each transaction of http is processed separately from each other.


Hope you’ve got a basic idea of what “http” is by now...


> Fun gibberish:
> You know why ‘http’ always has ‘://’ after it…
> It’s cause it’s annoyed that it isn’t getting enough attention..LOL :P
