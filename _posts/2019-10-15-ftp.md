### Konichiwa Internet!!!
<b>"f t p"</b> or as the nerds [as well as its formal full form] say is, File Transfer Protocol.

Now you must be thinking, “Oh man, another one of those protocols (︶︹︶)”

Well, HELL YEAH, cause it's different (and also very cool) from the one explained in my previous blog and serves a different and quite useful purpose…. DOWNLOAD(S)!!!
You heard it right, things/files you download as well as upload goes via ftp.
&nbsp;
Interested now…. Let’s dig a little deeper!!

Like http, ftp also has an ftp server and ftp client, which is obvious because whenever a user tries to download something, the user sends a request for it and the response for the request is received by the client (or user) in the form of download link or the file itself which is then downloaded on your device.

So basically ‘downloading’, is the copying or transfer of files from an ftp server to ftp client(s) and ‘uploading’ is just the reverse, that is, copying or transfer of files from an ftp client to a fet server.
&nbsp;
But nowadays, http has taken over most of this “purpose” of ftp.

Yea, I feel bad too…poor ftp (ಥ﹏ಥ)

But the question that arises is, “If http has mostly taken over this purpose of ftp, then why do we need ftp??”

Let me give you an example, Suppose you’re travelling by plane, we now know that planes have a set amount of weight you can carry with yourself right?! And you can’t carry more than that otherwise it goes with the cargo.

Same is the case for http, it can’t carry bulky and enormous information, so all the heavy lifting is done by ftp…. (̿▀̿‿ ̿▀̿ ̿)
Also, what makes ftp more reliable and efficient than http in carrying over information is its ability to not lose its “progress”.
&nbsp;
Hmm, now what do i mean by that?!…
You must have seen sometimes that when you download some file(s), a “Pause/Resume” button is present there in your browser, this means that we can anytime download our files, even when our connection to the Internet is lost :)
Which is sooo cool and also good for us…

### Phew…

Hope you’ve got a basic idea of the “ftp” by now…

And, if you want to get more hands on and want to play around with ftp, you can try to set up an ftp server by yourself on your pc/laptop using [File-Zilla](https://filezilla-project.org/), which is a free software available.
